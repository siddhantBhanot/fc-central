# Zenith Flow

## Intent

Run Income Assessment (IA) through the Zenith / AA-Orchestrator journey when Zenith is enabled for the applicable partner/product configuration.

The Zenith flow is structurally similar to the Perfios flow, but the external journey APIs are selected through configuration. When the Zenith configuration is enabled for a product, IA routes the applicable journey operations to Zenith APIs instead of the corresponding Perfios APIs.

The key debugging question is:

> **Was Zenith actually enabled and selected for this application, and did the Zenith transaction lifecycle progress correctly from journey-link generation through status, report retrieval, validation, and final IA state?**

---

                       Get Journey Transaction Status
                                      |
                                      v
                           Fetch Analytics Report
                                      |
                                      v
                            Business Validation
                                      |
                                      v
                         Update IA Application State
                                      |
                                      v
                         Kafka / Downstream Events
                                      |
                                      v
                             Final IA Outcome


Zenith should therefore be treated as a **journey implementation selected by configuration**, rather than as an entirely separate IA lifecycle.

---

# 2. Zenith vs Perfios Journey

The overall IA lifecycle remains similar:


Initiate IA
    ↓
Resolve configuration
    ↓
Select journey implementation
    ↓
Generate/Get journey link
    ↓
User completes external journey
    ↓
Fetch transaction status
    ↓
Fetch statement/analytics report
    ↓
Run IA business validation
    ↓
Update IA status
    ↓
Publish events / trigger downstream processing


The major difference is the external API used at each stage.

| IA Operation                   | Perfios Path                       | Zenith Path                             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Generate journey link          | `generate-link` / Perfios flow     | Zenith `get-journey-link`               |
| Fetch transaction status       | Perfios status API / callback flow | Zenith `get-journey-transaction-status` |
| Fetch insight/analytics report | Perfios report flow                | Zenith `get-analytics-report`           |
| External journey               | Perfios                            | Zenith / AA-Orchestrator                |
| Final IA processing            | Common IA business flow            | Common IA business flow                 |

The exact API names, paths, gateway methods, and request/response models should always be verified against the current implementation and configuration.

---

# 3. Configuration Determines Whether Zenith Is Used

Zenith is not necessarily used for every IA application.

The first question when debugging a Zenith issue is:

> **Was Zenith enabled for this application's partner/product configuration?**

The flow depends on configuration such as:


Partner
   +
Product
   +
Journey Context
   ↓
PartnerProductConfigurations
   ↓
Zenith-related configuration / toggle
   ↓
Zenith enabled?
   ↓
Select Zenith journey implementation


A common configuration-driven toggle is:


enableZenithOrchAPI


When this is enabled for the applicable partner/product context, IA uses Zenith / AA-Orchestrator APIs for the relevant journey.

When it is disabled, the application follows the existing configured journey path, such as Perfios.

### Important invariant

> **The presence of Zenith code or APIs in the repository does not mean a particular application is using Zenith.**

Always establish:


application
   ↓
partnerId + productCode + context
   ↓
resolved configuration
   ↓
enableZenithOrchAPI
   ↓
actual runtime branch


---

# 4. Configuration Resolution

Before tracing any Zenith API, establish how the application reached the Zenith branch.

Typical conceptual path:


Request
   ↓
Partner/Product Context
   ↓
ConfigFetcher
   ↓
PartnerProductConfigurations
   ↓
Zenith Configuration / Toggle
   ↓
enableZenithOrchAPI = true
   ↓
Zenith API Path


Relevant components include:

* `ConfigFetcher`
* `PartnerProductConfigurations`
* `CommonVersionResolver`
* `IncomeAssessmentApplicationServiceV3`
* Zenith-specific service/gateway classes
* `application.yaml`

For configuration debugging, inspect:

1. `partnerId`
2. `productCode`
3. journey/medium/context
4. resolved configuration
5. `enableZenithOrchAPI`
6. IA version
7. concrete service implementation selected
8. Zenith endpoint configuration

---

# 5. Application Initiation

The Zenith journey still starts from the normal IA application lifecycle.

Typical entry point:


POST /income-assessment-service/v1/initiate-application


Conceptually:


Partner Request
      ↓
Controller
      ↓
Version Resolution
      ↓
Configuration Resolution
      ↓
Create / Reuse IA Application
      ↓
Determine Journey
      ↓
Zenith enabled?
      ↓
Zenith Journey


The application record is persisted in:


incomeAssessmentApplications


Important identifiers to capture:


incomeAssessmentId
applicationReferenceId
commonClientTransactionId
serviceRequestId
partnerId
productCode


Do not assume these identifiers are interchangeable.

---

# 6. Zenith Journey Link

For Zenith-enabled journeys, the link-generation step uses the Zenith journey API rather than the equivalent Perfios API.

Conceptually:


IA Application
      ↓
Zenith enabled
      ↓
Get Journey Link
      ↓
Zenith / AA-Orchestrator
      ↓
Journey URL
      ↓
User Redirect


The Zenith operation is conceptually:


get-journey-link


This replaces the corresponding Perfios journey-link generation operation for the configured Zenith path.

### Important distinction

Successful `get-journey-link` means:

> Zenith successfully generated a journey link.

It does **not** mean:

> The user completed the Zenith journey.

Therefore:


get-journey-link success
        ≠
Zenith journey success


---

# 7. User Redirect / External Journey

After receiving the journey link:


IA
 ↓
Zenith get-journey-link
 ↓
Journey URL
 ↓
User redirected to Zenith
 ↓
User completes AA / statement journey


At this point, IA may be waiting for the external journey to progress.

A successful redirect should not automatically be interpreted as successful income assessment.

The following are separate milestones:


Link generated
      ↓
User redirected
      ↓
User started/completed external journey
      ↓
Zenith transaction reached required status
      ↓
Analytics report available
      ↓
IA validation completed


---

# 8. Zenith Transaction Status

After the external journey progresses, IA needs to determine the transaction state.

For Zenith, this is handled through:


get-journey-transaction-status


Conceptually:


IA Application
      ↓
Zenith Transaction
      ↓
get-journey-transaction-status
      ↓
Zenith Status
      ↓
Interpret Zenith Response
      ↓
Continue / Retry / Fail / Fetch Report


This stage is critical because:

> **A successful API response does not necessarily mean the IA journey succeeded.**

The Zenith response must be interpreted according to the current business logic.

Possible conceptual outcomes include:


Journey still in progress
        ↓
Retry / wait

Journey completed
        ↓
Fetch analytics report

Journey failed
        ↓
Map error / update IA state

Unexpected response
        ↓
Error handling / RCA


The exact Zenith statuses and their mappings should be taken from the current Zenith response models and business logic rather than inferred from API names.

---

# 9. Analytics Report

Once the Zenith journey reaches the appropriate state, IA fetches the analytics/insight report.

The Zenith operation is:


get-analytics-report


Conceptually:


Zenith Transaction
      ↓
Transaction Status = Ready
      ↓
get-analytics-report
      ↓
Analytics / Insight Report
      ↓
Parse / Persist
      ↓
Business Validation


### Important distinction

These are separate failure boundaries:


Transaction status API
        ↓
Report availability
        ↓
Report retrieval
        ↓
Report parsing
        ↓
Business validation


Therefore, if the Zenith transaction status is successful but IA remains stuck, do not immediately assume that the Zenith status API failed.

Check whether:

* the analytics report was requested
* Zenith returned the report
* the response was successfully parsed
* the report was persisted
* business validation executed
* the IA state transition succeeded
* the next Kafka event was published

---

# 10. Analytics Report → IA Business Validation

The Zenith report ultimately feeds the common IA business-processing layer.

Conceptually:


Zenith Analytics Report
        ↓
Income / Statement Data
        ↓
IA Business Rules
        ↓
Business Outcome
        ↓
IA Status


Relevant business rules may include:

* `incomeCreditGapRule`
* `chequeBounceLimitRule`
* `lastNMonthsIncomeRule`
* `numberOfIncomeCreditsRule`
* `statementStatusRule`

The important architectural distinction is:

> **Zenith provides the external journey and data; IA remains responsible for interpreting the data and determining the IA business outcome.**

Therefore a Zenith API success does not necessarily result in:


INCOME_ASSESSMENT_SUCCESS


The report can be successfully retrieved and still result in:


INCOME_ASSESSMENT_FAILED
INCOME_ASSESSMENT_REJECTED
INCOME_ASSESSMENT_REFERRED
POLICY_NORMS_NOT_MET


depending on the configured business rules and state.

---

# 11. IA Status Update

After Zenith data is processed, IA updates the application state.

The state is persisted in:


incomeAssessmentApplications


Conceptually:


Zenith Result
     ↓
Report Processing
     ↓
Business Validation
     ↓
State Guard
     ↓
MongoDB
     ↓
IA Status


Before concluding that a status update failed, inspect:

1. current application status
2. previous status
3. status type
4. business validation result
5. state guard
6. attempt information
7. callback/status timestamps
8. Zenith transaction identifier
9. persisted report/analytics data

A valid state guard can intentionally prevent a transition.

Therefore:


"Status did not change"


does not automatically mean:


"Database update failed"


---

# 12. Kafka and Downstream Propagation

After Zenith processing, IA may publish events for downstream consumers.

Conceptually:


Zenith Processing
      ↓
IA State Update
      ↓
Kafka Event
      ↓
Consumer
      ↓
Downstream API / DB
      ↓
Next State


The following are independent success boundaries:


Zenith API success
        ≠
IA processing success
        ≠
Mongo update success
        ≠
Kafka publish success
        ≠
Kafka consumer success
        ≠
Downstream API success


For example:


get-analytics-report
       ↓ success

IA validation
       ↓ success

Mongo status update
       ↓ success

Kafka publish
       ↓ FAILED

Downstream consumer
       ↓ never receives event


In such a case, the Zenith integration itself may have worked correctly even though the overall workflow did not complete.

---

# 13. Zenith API Integration Map

The Zenith journey can be thought of as a sequence of external operations:


┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ IA Application              │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               ↓
      Configuration Check
               ↓
      Zenith Enabled?
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ get-journey-link             │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               ↓
        User Redirect
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Zenith / AA Journey         │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ get-journey-transaction-   │
│ status                      │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               ↓
       Transaction Ready
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ get-analytics-report        │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               ↓
      Analytics / Insight
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ IA Business Validation      │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               ↓
        IA Status Update
               ↓
       Kafka / Downstream


---

# 14. Zenith Configuration and Endpoint Resolution

Zenith API behavior depends on endpoint configuration.

Relevant static configuration is under:


axis.zenith.*


Important configuration concepts include:


axis.zenith.zenithBaseUrl
axis.zenith.initiateBsaEnc


The exact endpoint/property names should always be verified against the current `application.yaml`.

For the Zenith BSA integration, an important endpoint is:


/aa-orch/fiu/api/v1/initiateBSA


When investigating an HTTP failure, verify:


Base URL
   +
Configured path
   +
HTTP method
   +
Headers
   +
Content-Type
   +
Request body
   +
Environment
   +
Stub/mock configuration


Do not immediately assume that a 404/405/415 is a Zenith business failure.

---

# 15. Zenith BSA Flow

The BSA initiation flow is related to the Zenith journey but should be treated as a distinct integration boundary.

Conceptually:


IA
 ↓
BSA Initiation
 ↓
Zenith / AA-Orchestrator
 ↓
POST /aa-orch/fiu/api/v1/initiateBSA
 ↓
BSA / AA Processing
 ↓
Statements / Analytics
 ↓
IA Processing


Relevant code anchors include:


InitiateBsaController
InitiateBsaModels
ZenithOrchestratorGateway


When the BSA API fails, determine whether the failure occurred at:


Controller validation
      ↓
Request construction
      ↓
Gateway
      ↓
HTTP request
      ↓
Zenith / AA-Orchestrator
      ↓
Response parsing
      ↓
Business handling


---

# 16. Zenith Error Handling

Zenith errors pass through multiple layers.

Conceptually:


Zenith Response
      ↓
HTTP / Network Error
      ↓
Zenith Gateway
      ↓
Error Mapping
      ↓
IA Error
      ↓
Business Decision
      ↓
Status / Event / Response


Configuration-backed Zenith error mappings may influence the final IA behavior.

Relevant configuration group:


ZenithErrorCodeAndConfigMapping


Therefore, when a Zenith error results in an unexpected IA status, inspect both:


Zenith response


and:


Zenith error-code mapping configuration


before concluding that the service has incorrect business logic.

---

# 17. Retry and Timeout Behavior

Zenith operations may be affected by retry configuration and reactive retry operators.

Typical patterns include:


retry
retryWhen
onErrorResume
onErrorMap
switchIfEmpty


The important distinction is:

> **A configured retry does not automatically mean every Zenith error is retryable.**

For a failed Zenith operation, determine:


Did the request fail?
        ↓
Was the error retryable?
        ↓
Was retry configured?
        ↓
Was retry actually triggered?
        ↓
How many attempts occurred?
        ↓
What happened after the final attempt?


For transaction-status operations, also distinguish:


Zenith transaction still processing


from:


Zenith API request failed


These represent different failure modes.

---

# 18. Missing Callback / Status Progression

Zenith journeys can also involve asynchronous progression.

When the expected Zenith result does not reach IA, investigate the full chain:


Zenith generated transaction
        ↓
Zenith journey progressed
        ↓
Expected callback/notification generated?
        ↓
IA received it?
        ↓
Kafka event published?
        ↓
Kafka consumer received it?
        ↓
State guard accepted it?
        ↓
MongoDB updated?
        ↓
get-journey-transaction-status invoked if required?
        ↓
Analytics report fetched?
        ↓
Next event published?


Do not collapse all of these into:

> "Zenith callback was not received."

First establish where the chain stopped.

---

# 19. Multi-Attempt / Retry Scenario

A single IA application may have multiple external journey attempts.

Conceptually:


IA Application A
   |
   +-- Zenith Transaction T1
   |       |
   |       +-- Journey incomplete / delayed
   |
   +-- Retry
           |
           +-- Zenith Transaction T2
                   |
                   +-- Journey completes


A late event or status response associated with `T1` must not automatically be interpreted as the result of `T2`.

Always correlate:


incomeAssessmentId
applicationReferenceId
commonClientTransactionId
serviceRequestId
Zenith transaction ID
attempt number
event ID
timestamp


### Critical invariant

> **Application identity and Zenith transaction identity are different dimensions of the journey.**

Never debug a multi-attempt issue using only `applicationReferenceId`.

---

# 20. Common Zenith Failure Patterns

## 20.1 Zenith APIs not being called

Check:


Partner/Product
      ↓
Resolved configuration
      ↓
enableZenithOrchAPI
      ↓
IA version
      ↓
Concrete service implementation
      ↓
Zenith branch


Possible causes:

* Zenith disabled for the product
* wrong partner/product configuration
* wrong configuration environment
* wrong version bucket
* unexpected journey context
* code path bypassing Zenith branch

---

## 20.2 `get-journey-link` fails

Investigate:


IA request
→ Zenith configuration
→ Base URL
→ Endpoint path
→ HTTP method
→ Request payload
→ Headers
→ Zenith response


For 404/405/415 specifically, verify endpoint and request construction before investigating business rules.

---

## 20.3 Journey link generated but IA remains in progress

Remember:


get-journey-link success


only proves link generation.

Check:

* user redirect
* Zenith journey progress
* transaction status
* callback/notification
* `get-journey-transaction-status`
* retry/timeout behavior

---

## 20.4 Transaction status succeeds but report is missing

Trace:


get-journey-transaction-status
       ↓
Does Zenith consider transaction ready?
       ↓
get-analytics-report
       ↓
HTTP response
       ↓
Parsing
       ↓
Persistence


Do not assume successful transaction status guarantees report availability.

---

## 20.5 Analytics report fetched but IA status is incorrect

Trace:


Analytics Report
       ↓
Parsing
       ↓
Business Rules
       ↓
Business Outcome
       ↓
State Guard
       ↓
Mongo Update
       ↓
Kafka Event


The problem may be in IA business validation rather than Zenith.

---

## 20.6 Zenith API succeeds but downstream remains stuck

Check:


Zenith API
      ↓
IA processing
      ↓
MongoDB
      ↓
Kafka Producer
      ↓
Kafka Topic
      ↓
Consumer
      ↓
Downstream API


Kafka publication and downstream processing are separate failure boundaries.

# 24. Zenith-to-Context-Document Map

Use the context documents together:

| Question                                        | Primary Context                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Is Zenith enabled for this product?             | `configurations.md`                  |
| Which API does Zenith use?                      | `integrations.md`                    |
| What is the complete Zenith lifecycle?          | `zenith-flow.md`                     |
| Where is IA state stored?                       | `database.md`                        |
| Why did IA status change?                       | `business-logic.md`                  |
| Why did Zenith/API fail?                        | `error-handling.md`                  |
| Why did the event/downstream flow stop?         | `kafka-events.md`                    |
| Where should I debug first?                     | `troubleshooting.md`                 |
| How does Zenith fit into complete IA lifecycle? | `income-assessment-flow.md`          |
| How does Perfios compare with Zenith?           | `perfios-flow.md` + `zenith-flow.md` |

# 26. Core Zenith Invariants

1. **Zenith usage is configuration-driven.**
2. **`enableZenithOrchAPI` must be evaluated in the correct partner/product/context.**
3. **Zenith link generation does not mean the external journey completed.**
4. **Zenith transaction status and analytics report retrieval are separate stages.**
5. **A successful Zenith API response does not necessarily mean IA succeeded.**
6. **Zenith provides external journey/data; IA owns business validation and final IA state.**
7. **IA application identity and Zenith transaction identity are different.**
8. **A single IA application may have multiple Zenith transaction attempts.**
9. **Late responses/events must be correlated to the correct transaction/attempt.**
10. **MongoDB state and Kafka/downstream state are not atomic.**
11. **A Zenith integration success does not imply Kafka/downstream success.**
12. **HTTP 404/405/415 should first be investigated as endpoint/request/environment problems.**
13. **Configured retry does not mean every Zenith failure is retryable.**
14. **Error-code mappings can change the business interpretation of Zenith failures without changing integration code.**
15. **The actual repository implementation and resolved configuration are the source of truth over historical documentation.**

# 27. Preferred Mental Model

For any Zenith issue, trace:


Which IA application?
        ↓
Which partner/product?
        ↓
Which context/configuration?
        ↓
Was Zenith enabled?
        ↓
Which IA version?
        ↓
Which Zenith API?
        ↓
Was the Zenith transaction created?
        ↓
Which transaction/attempt?
        ↓
Did the journey progress?
        ↓
What did get-journey-transaction-status return?
        ↓
Was get-analytics-report called?
        ↓
Was the report retrieved and parsed?
        ↓
Which IA business rules executed?
        ↓
Which state guard executed?
        ↓
What was persisted in MongoDB?
        ↓
Which Kafka event was published?
        ↓
Which consumer processed it?
        ↓
What downstream action occurred?
        ↓
What was the final IA state?


The key RCA question is:

> **At which step did the Zenith transaction lifecycle first diverge from the expected IA flow?**
